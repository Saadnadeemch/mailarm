                <<< MAILARM — GMAIL ALARM EXTENSION >>>
===========================================================

MailArm automatically checks your Gmail for new emails 
from specific senders or with certain keywords, and alerts 
you instantly with a sound and an on-screen notification.

-----------------------------------------------------------
                   <<< SETUP INSTRUCTIONS >>>
-----------------------------------------------------------

To make sure the extension works properly, follow these steps:

1️⃣ Enable Sound Permission:
   → Open this link: chrome://settings/content/siteDetails?site=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com
   → Turn ON the "Sound" option for Gmail.

2️⃣ Optional (Recommended for Freelancers):
   → If you’re using MailArm to get alerts from freelancing platforms 
     like Fiverr or Upwork, go to your notification settings there 
     and set "Email Delivery" to "Immediate" instead of "5–10 minutes."

-----------------------------------------------------------
                    <<< HOW IT WORKS >>>
-----------------------------------------------------------

1️⃣ SETUP AND RULES
   - You can add one or more rules (email address + keyword).
   - These rules are automatically saved in Chrome’s local storage.

2️⃣ BACKGROUND MONITORING
   - A background process checks Gmail every few seconds.
   - It continues running even when the popup is closed.

3️⃣ GMAIL SCANNING
   - The extension refreshes your Gmail inbox automatically.
   - It looks for unread emails that match your rules.

4️⃣ TRIGGERING THE ALARM
   - When a matching email is found, it plays an alarm sound 
     and shows an alert message on your Gmail screen.

5️⃣ STOPPING THE ALARM
   - You can stop the alarm manually from the popup.
   - The system prevents multiple triggers for the same sender 
     within a short time.

6️⃣ SAVED SETTINGS
   - All rules and preferences are stored locally.
   - When Chrome restarts, everything resumes automatically.
